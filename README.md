GAUSS: Gillespie Algorithm Used in Stochastic Simulations
http://www.scireact.co
--------------------------------------------------------------

Over the course of five weeks, our team developed GAUSS(Gillespie Algorithm Used for Stochastic Simulation), a simulator available as a web application and as a command line tool.. This tool models complex biological systems using Gillespieâ€™s algorithm, a method for stochastic simulation. Stochastic simulation is a powerful tool for investigating the stochastic nature of real biological systems. Using Python, we developed a parser, a simulation engine, and a testing framework. We applied our simulator to several applications such as the MAP kinase cascade, as well as to interactions between native and invasive ants. We used Django, a Python web development framework, to develop our web application. The application is available to the public,, and can also be used to simulate non-biological systems.
